    <p>The seal of trust – Logo of State Bank of India finds its roots since 1st October, 1971. A brilliant designer
        from an ace institution Mr. Shekhar Kammat at National Institute of Design crafted it. You may find it an
        appearance of key hole at first look related with deposit locker depicting safety which obviously visualize safe
        banking but you are wrong in the assessment. It also seems a mirror image of Kankaria Lake, Ahmedabad however
        the designer has rejected this claim too. Mr Shekhar revealed that the concept of the logo can be discovered in
        the artwork itself. He ideated a consumer (man) at the centre of the circle (banking system) in negative space.
        One could find every possible characteristic of an ideal design in its purest form in the logo. It is a
        relevant, versatile, simplest, scalable, monotonous & impactful vector design and most importantly memorable. In
        my personal graphical capability I found SBI logo, one of best logo ever seen.

        The Transformation: As credentials of State of Bank of India inflate, it reflected in its identity also. Being a
        creature of design industry I found the logo also is being affected with new transformation of the bank at
        parallel. You can notice the consumer symbol in the logo is healthier and bigger than earlier which claims its
        expansion as bigger structure and better service after amalgamation of 5 subsidiary family banks in itself from
        1st April, 2017. Also, the logo adopted acronym of “SBI” in support of consumer-friendly & colloquial approach.
        The typography of the text is quite balanced and appears more abstemious, trendy and clearheaded. The navy blue
        adds extra dimension to the artwork positively. I appreciate the smart work of the design agency from heart to
        do justice to the age long brand visual with adequate respect. The logo has retained same value of trust meeting
        conventional renovation of the brand. </p><br><br>
    <p>It commands a substantial market share, holding 23% of assets, as well as a quarter share in both deposits and
        total loans markets. Its prominence is such that even MBA entrance exam candidates aspire for SBI positions.

        Established in 1806 in Kolkata, the State Bank of India (SBI Bank) underwent significant transformations in its
        early years. Within three years of its inception, it acquired its charter and was rebranded as the Bank of
        Bengal in 1809.

        Notably, it was India's inaugural joint-stock bank, sponsored by the Bengal Government. Alongside the Bank of
        Bengal, the Bank of Madras and the Bank of Bombay were also integral parts of this joint venture, playing
        pivotal roles in modernizing banking practices.

        These three banks emerged as Anglo-Indian institutions, driven by several factors, including the stagnant state
        of the Indian economy, the demands of local European commerce, and the financial imperatives of imperial
        governance.

        The evolution of the State Bank of India was influenced by ideas imported from England and Europe, as well as
        shifts in the local trading landscape and India's economic ties with Europe and the global economy.</p><br><br>
    <p>The State Bank of India (SBI) stands as a formidable entity within the banking landscape, bolstered by several
        key factors. It holds the distinction of being the oldest bank in the country based on the size of its balance
        sheet.

        Moreover, its substantial market capitalization, extensive network of bank branches, and robust profit margins
        position it as a formidable competitor against private sector banks nationwide.

        Currently, the bank is diversifying its business portfolio through strategic partnerships, presenting
        significant growth opportunities. These partnerships encompass various sectors, including General Insurance,
        Pension Funds, Private Equity, Custodial Services, Mobile Banking, Structured Products, Advisory Services, and
        Point of Sale Merchant Acquisition.

        Furthermore, SBI is focusing on expanding its wholesale banking capabilities to cater to the high-end corporate
        sector, offering a plethora of services and products.

        The bank is also venturing into derivative instruments and structured products, while simultaneously
        consolidating its global treasury operations.

        Presently, SBI holds the distinction of being the largest arranger of external commercial borrowings in the
        country and a major provider of infrastructure debt. Additionally, it stands as the sole Indian bank listed in
        the Fortune 500 roster.

        In addition to its core banking services, the State Bank of India has been actively engaged in non-profit
        initiatives since 1973, exemplified by its Community Services Banking program.

        Through this initiative, administrative offices and branches across the nation actively support and participate
        in numerous social welfare activities and causes.

        Furthermore, the bank has introduced three digital banking platforms to streamline financial transactions for
        its customers.

        Two of these platforms are tailored to provide doorstep banking services, employing TAB banking methodology. One
        caters to housing loan applicants, while the other serves customers seeking to open savings accounts.</p>
